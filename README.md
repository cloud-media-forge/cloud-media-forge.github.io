## LLMs Integration

This project includes support for the `/llms.txt` specification, which helps language models better understand the documentation structure.

Two files are generated:

1. `/llms.txt` - A structured file that follows the llms.txt specification
   - Includes an overview of MediaForge
   - Provides links to markdown versions of all documentation pages, organized by category
   - Clean, machine-readable content optimized for LLM context

2. `/llms-full.txt` - A comprehensive file containing all documentation content
   - Contains the complete content of all documentation files in a single document
   - Includes a table of contents organized by category
   - Optimized for LLMs with larger context windows
   - Allows LLMs to search through the entire documentation without following links

The markdown versions of all pages are also generated and served alongside the HTML versions with `.md` appended to the original URL.

To generate these files manually, run:

```bash
pnpm generate:llms-txt
```
